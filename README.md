# hello-world
my first git hub file
hello world/readme.md = i have made the following changes, 
1: i wrote a little about myself and why i am here on github
2: i wrote to let everyone know i am new and learning new languages and need all the help i can get.

I am creating this file for my own personal education of how github works with editing files and now im suppose to explain a little about myself. I am new to everything that has to do with coding and programming computer languages, i am loving learning how to code and all about this new field of creativity. i love learning, so far i have learned the begginers course on "sololearn" i have completed the courses on C++, Java, and Python. yet i still cannot write my own logical program. so i am on github to learn and i am useing unity to learn how to make games. it is all very exciting, new and fun.
